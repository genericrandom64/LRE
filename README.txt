# Lagoon Rendering Engine

This is a rendering engine designed for the
game Lagoon. It's meant to be generalized for
many use cases, but has some functionality that
might make certain kinds of tasks more
convenient. It includes a tool to create and
edit resource packs, which can be loaded by the
renderer.
